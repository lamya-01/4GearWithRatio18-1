# 4GearsWithRatio18-1

## Overview

This project utilizes the online Gear Generator tool available at [GearGenerator.com](https://geargenerator.com). The link provided leads to a specific configuration of gears designed for a particular purpose. This README file will guide you through the setup, usage, and customization of this gear configuration.

## Gear Configuration Details

### Link to Configuration

Access the gear configuration using this link: [Gear Configuration](https://geargenerator.com/#75,75,25,20,1,2,281976.2000000017,4,1,12,3,4,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,72,18,4,27,-30,0,0,0,0,1,1,12,2,6,27,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,36,6,6,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,-774)

### Configuration Parameters

The gear setup includes the following parameters:

- Gear 1:
  - Number of teeth: 12
  - Pitch diameter: 3
  - Diametral pitch : 4
  - Pressure Angle : 27
  - Position (x, y): (3, 3)
  - Connected to Gear 2

- Gear 2:
  - Number of teeth: 72
  - Pitch diameter: 18
  - Diametral pitch : 4
  - Pressure Angle : 27
  - Position (x, y): (12.093, 8.25)
  - Connected to Gear 3

    Ratio between Gear1 and Gear2 is 72/12 = 6

- Gear 3:
  - Number of teeth: 12
  - Pitch diameter: 2
  - Diametral pitch : 6
  - Pressure Angle : 27
  - Position (x, y): (12.093, 8.25)
  - Connected to Gear 4

- Gear 4:
  - Number of teeth: 36
  - Pitch diameter: 6
  - Diametral pitch : 6
  - Pressure Angle : 27
  - Position (x, y): (16.093, 8.25)
 
    Ratio between Gear3 and Gear4 is 36/12 = 3

     Final Ratio is 6 * 3 = 18

## Usage

1. Accessing the Configuration:
   - Click on the provided link to open the gear configuration in Gear Generator.
   - The link will automatically load the predefined gear setup.

2. Viewing the Configuration:
   - Once the link opens, you will see a graphical representation of the gears.
   - You can zoom in and out to view the gears in detail.

3. Modifying the Configuration:
   - To change any gear parameters, select the gear you wish to modify.
   - Adjust the number of teeth, diameter, position, and rotation as needed.
   - Save the changes by exporting the configuration or copying the updated link.

4. Exporting the Configuration:
   - You can export the gear configuration as an image or a vector file for further use.
   - Use the export options provided in Gear Generator.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the gear setup according to your project requirements. You can add or remove gears, change their sizes, and adjust their positions. Ensure that the connections between gears are correctly maintained to achieve the desired mechanical behavior.
